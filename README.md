there are different types of tumor, 
Benign tumor and Malignant tumor we know that a human body is made of cells and tissues and organs and all these kind of things and all the cells in our body divides and grows and sometimes what happen is some of the cells in our body may divided repeatedly without some control so in that case it forms an abnormal masks and abnormal tissue and those abnormal mass is called as a tumor.
so these tumor can be called as Benign. if those tumor doesn't move to the other part of the body whereas Malignant tumors are those which have the capability to move to the other parts of the body so all those Malignant tumors  are called as Cancerous tumor.

As per Breast Cancer Prediction,
The first step is data collection so we will try to figure out the data which we are work on and once we have a Dataset once the data collection process is completed.

I'm process this data so I cannot feed this raw data to Machine Learning model. 

So there are data pre processing step cover here.
Once a process the data and then I need to split data into Training data and Testing data. 
So the purpose of this is train our machine learning model using the training data and then evaluate my model using the test data so this is the purpose of splitting the data into training data and test data.

I used Logistics Regression model because Logistics Regression is one of the best model when it comes to Binary classification. Binary classification is define as the classify the data points into two types 
Here is the two types of Classification are Benign and Malignant or in other words it is nothing but 0 or 1
 
So here I'm using a logistic regression model.

After I have train a Logistics Regression model and also do evaluation on this model using the test data so all things are completed I have a new data.
This new data the model are classify the particular tumor is Benign or Malignant.
